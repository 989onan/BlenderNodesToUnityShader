# BlenderNodesToUnityShader

# About:
This is a simple description for now, but this is a tool I made for Blender and Unity users alike. do you hate that there are blender materials
that blender artists made that are simple, cool looking, but not for unity? Not anymore! This will generate a shader that does a "#pragma 4.0" shader 
which will look very close to the version it looks like in blender. This is not magic! It's real. 

# Alpha!?!?:
Yes. This is alpha. I wrote this over the course of a week, and has many bugs that still need to be worked out. It has gone through about 30 minutes of training and not all nodes
have been tested, and not all configurations. I (@989onan) will be making commits and trying to patch as many bugs as possible! 

# This tool is crappy! You suck!:
Yes. I know. Now if you want to actually make it better, please ask your friends that know python to help me on the journey to make this code an amazing tool for all!
Also, point out ways I can write the code for different nodes, and how I can make code that replicates what blender does in the form of Unity3D shader language.
I am kinda dumb since i'm a junior programmer, so I will try my best to implement as many nodes as I can.

# Why is "X" node not supported!?!?:
well most likely it's because it's a blender only node. How would unity make a shader that has volumetric smoke or dust which isn't particles? It can't. Exactly. This and other
similar explinations are most likely the reason.

# How to install:
1. download a zip from the releases page, or download the folder in the root of this project as a zip. Then install from file and choose the zip like any other blender addon.
